CELL VIEWER
--------------------------------------

The application of fluorescence microscopy to many areas of biology is still limited by its resolution of around 250 nm. This resolution is inadequate for observing the inner architecture of many subcellular structures. For example, a chromatin segment might appear as a sigle entity. However, this limitation has been overcome in the past several years. Exploiting the photoswitching and photoactivation properties of fluorescent proteins and organic dyes, has resulted in some new super-resolution imaging techniques, collectively referred to as single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). With these data, we are able to oberved chromosomes organization into small and large domains.

In ordre to provide new insights into biological processes at molecular scale, this complex data demands an informatics infrastructure with tools to collect, store, manipulate, and analyze imaging data in a reproducible manner. CellViewer aims at developing this new informatics infraestructure, to understand the mechanism of self-renewal and differentiation in stem cell.

While super-resolution data are accumulating, computational analysis algorithms are needed to extract in automatic way the rich information visible in those cell samples. This code provides tools to extract part of this information.

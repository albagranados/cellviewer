If we build an image in a proper way from our pointillist data set computer vision methods and image-analysis methods can be applied. 

Computer vision is an application area of Artificial Intelligence (AI), broadly defined as the science and engineering of making machines capable of extracting information from an image in order to solve a particular task. Computer vision systems are imple- mented in a wide range of industrial and scientific applications, including iris identification, or object recognition, organization of image databases, object modeling. 

In our case, in biological screening, the principal objective is to determine whether an experimental perturbation leads to a cellular phenotype, and to classify cell morphologies, for example the Vermicelli. Thus, it seems beneficial in our problem to use computer vision techniques.

In order to use computer vision algorithms, it is necessary to transform the point pattern of the raw data into an image. Then, the computer vision program will incorporate the steps of image processing and image analysis.

In image- processing we need to transform the signal to emphasize a particular aspect of an image, that is, we need a set of objects or features. In turn, descriptive features need to be derived so that provide information relevant for classification. 

Then, the it is necessary to perform image analysis, that is, interpret the image content, by machine-learning or data mining methods are used to decide the values of the features that distinguish between the classes
